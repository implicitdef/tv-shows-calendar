# A visual calendar for your TV shows


Hosted at https://www.implicitdef.com/tv-shows-calendar

This calendar helps you keep track of when your favorites TV shows are aired, season by season.

Useful if you like to wait the end of a season to watch it.

By default only a tiny subset of shows are shown. If you sign in, you will be able to add/remove shows from the calendar.
