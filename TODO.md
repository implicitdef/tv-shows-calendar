- push last modifs on prod
- set correct webpack mode (currently hardcoded to development)
- maybe make adjustments for prod in webpack conf (perf improvements, etc.)
- maybe merge webpack confs as much as possible
- fix auth bug : if we come back later (after exiting browser ? or after session expired ? we see an error banner which disappears after a refresh)
