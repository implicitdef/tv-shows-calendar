- moving to yarn and upgrading everything including webpack
- - set correct webpack mode (currently hardcoded to development)
- maybe upgrade every library one by one as much as possible
- maybe move to create-react-app
- maybe upgrade to webpack
- maybe make adjustments for prod in webpack conf (perf improvements, etc.)
- maybe merge webpack confs as much as possible
- fix auth bug : if we come back later (after exiting browser ? or after session expired ? we see an error banner which disappears after a refresh)
